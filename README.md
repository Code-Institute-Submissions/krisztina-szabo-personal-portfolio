# Krisztina Szabó Personal Portfolio Website
This page is my personal portfolio website. I made as my first milestone project at Code Institute.
The purpose of the project is to present myself and my work to potencial customers and recruiters.
Browsing this page the user can get every kind of useful information about me: my portfolio, my work history, my personal interests, a group of link to my social media account and to my GitHub repository. If the user it's not interested in browsing, they can reach my resumé in printable (pdf) version directly from the homepage.
The website contains 4 pages: Homepage, About me, My portfolio and Get in Touch. I've built my project using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

### Wireframes
 When I started working on this project, I've had a picture of the site in my head.This picture changed a lot in the last few weeks. You can see the progress below.

## Features
### Existing Features

- On the Homepage (index.html) you can see the menu navigation bar with relevant Fontawesome icons. When you hover, the background color becomes green (#3b853f). This color see you through the whole page, you find it in the portrait picture,  borders, buttons. Besides this gradiation, I've used only black and white.
You can also see a small introduction, a portrait picture, three navigation buttons helping in orientation on the page, and also three rounded icons leading you to my social media profiles.
- On About me page you can find to navigation bars, first one is the menu I've presented before, the other one is the footer containing two buttons, drawing the attention to my LinkedIn profile and GitHub repositiories. These two navigation items appears on three of the four pages (I thought that having a footer on my Homepage makes the general aspect too cluttered.
On this page I have a small introduction about myself, and a timeline with my imaginary and real work history. The basic structure of the timeline was written by written by Andrew R McHugh (https://codepen.io). It was significantly modified.
- My portfolio page is a showcase of my recent work (also fiction). Under the card you can see the name of the project, and for more information, you can click on the navigation button located beneath each of the cards.
-On the Get in touch page you can contact me using a form. After typing your name and email address, you can choose the best option about scheduling the project, and you can also tell me about your ideas.
Your name and your valid email address are required.  

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future I plan to add more real work experience to make My portfolio and About me pages better. 
- In my Get in touch page I would like to fix my form to work properly, so when I have enough knowledge for this, I will come back to this section, and I will make my submit button work.
