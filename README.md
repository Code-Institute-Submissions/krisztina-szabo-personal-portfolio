<h1>Krisztina Szabó Personal Portfolio Website </h1>
<p> This page is my personal portfolio website. I made as my first milestone project at Code Institute </p>
<p>The purpose of the project is to present myself and my work to potencial customers and recruiters. </p>
<p>Browsing this page the user can get every kind of useful information about me: my portfolio, my work history, my personal interests, a group of link to my social media account and to my GitHub repository. If the user it's not interested in browsing, they can reach my resumé in printable (pdf) version directly from the homepage.  </p>
<p> The website contains 4 pages: Homepage, About me, My protfolio and Get in Touch. I've built my project using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.</p>
